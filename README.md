#Social Ad Spotter

###Chrome browser extension that monitors how many ads Facebook and Twitter slot in people's feeds.

---

Facebook has talked about how it's running out of places to stuff ads in people's news feed.
So I wanted to get an idea of how many ads it's actually stuffing in my feed.

When scrolling through Facebook's news feed or Twitter's timeline, the extension will highlight ads as they appear, and clicking on the extension's icon will open a popup window displaying the number of ads and organic posts as well as the names of the advertisers and where their ads were placed.

The extension is available in the Chome Web Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/social-ad-spotter/mnamnfmlcfnlecdbpiimibppkjabagok).

I'm still testing it for bugs. My plan is to eventually build a way for people to submit the number of ads in their feeds to a database for an aggregate view.
