#Facebook Ad Slots Extension

###A Chrome browser extension that monitors how many ads are in Facebook's news feed and where they're placed.

---

Facebook has talked about how it's running out of places to stuff ads in people's news feed.
So I wanted to get an idea of how many ads it's actually stuffing in my feed.

The extension is private right now, but my plan is to eventually open it up and build a way
for people to submit the number of ads in their feeds to a database for an aggregate view.
